## Aggregation

### Basic Aggregation Stages

The most **common** stages are:

| **Name** | **Description**                    |
|----------|------------------------------------|
| $match   | equivalent to find({})             |
| $project | equivalent to find({}, projection) |
| $sort    | equivalent to find().sort(order)   |
| $limit   | equivalent to find().limit(num)    |
| $skip    | equivalent to find().skip(num)     |
| $count   | equivalent to find().count()       |

When using these at the start of a pipeline, the query optimizer transforms them to a find()

### Comparing Aggregation syntax

Find the **name** of the host in Canada with the most total listings **total_listings_count**:

```javascript
usesample_airbnb

let query = {"address.country": "Canada"}
let projection = {"host.host_total_listings_count": 1, "host.host_name": 1}
let sort = {"host.host_total_listings_count": -1};

db.listingsAndReviews.find(query, projection).sort(sort).limit(1)

db.listingsAndReviews.aggregate([
    {$match: query},
    {$sort: sort},
    {$limit: 1},
    {$project: projection}
])
```

### Dollar Overloading

Dollars are used in a **number of ways** in aggregation syntax, this can be confusing for a beginner

- On the Left they refer to a **stage** or **expression name**
- On the Right they refer to a **field value**
- Double dollars refer to a temporary variable or constant
- You can also use $literal if you need a dollar symbol as a variable.

```javascript
db.collection.aggregate([
    {$match: {a: 5}} // Dollar on left means a stage name - in this case a $match stage
])

db.collection.aggregate([
    {$set: {area: {$multiply: [5, 10]}}}// $multiply is an expression name left of colon
])

db.collection.aggregate([
    {$set: {b: "$a"}} // Dollar on right of colon "$a" refers to the value of field a
])

db.collection.aggregate([
    {
        $set: {
            priceswithtax: {
                $map: {
                    input: "$prices",
                    as: "p",
                    in: {$multiply: ["$$p", 1.08]} // $$p -> temporary loop variable "p" declared in $map
                }
            }
        }
    }
])

db.collection.aggregate([
    {$set: {displayprice: {$literal: "$12"}}} // Use $literal when you want either a string with a $ or to $project an explicit number
])
```

### Aggregation Expressions

Aggregation stages perform operations like filtering (\$match) documents, grouping documents, or transforming (\$project, \$set) documents.

Expressions can be a literal value:

```javascript
{$set: {answer: 42}}
```

Value of another field:
```javascript
{$set: {answer: "$ultimate_answer"}}
```

Calculation:
```javascript
{$set: {answer: { $multiply: [6, 7]}}}
```

### Arithmetic Expression Operators

- There are many type of expressions
- Expression arguments are always an array.

```javascript
let sub =  { $subtract: [ "$cost", "$price" ] }
let add1 = { $add: [ "$price", "$shipping" ] }
let add2 = { $add: [ "$price", "$shipping", "$tax" ] }
let add3 = { $add: ["$price", { $multiply : ["$price", "$taxrate" ] }]}
let div =  { $divide: [ "$quantity", "$price" ] }

use test
db.arithmeticExpression.drop();
db.arithmeticExpression.insertOne({
    cost: 10,
    price: 12.99,
    shipping: 2.99,
    quantity: 3,
    tax: 2.25,
    taxrate: 1.2
});

let pipeline = [{ 
    $set: {
        fsub: sub,
        fadd1: add1,
        fadd2: add2,
        fadd3: add3,
        fdiv: div
    }
}]

db.arithmeticExpression.aggregate(pipeline).explain().command.pipeline
```

### String Expression Operators
```javascript
let concat = { $concat: [ "$firstname", "_", "$lastname" ] }
let ltrim = { $ltrim:  {input: "$emailaddress"} }
let index = { $indexOfCP: [ "$emailaddress", "@" ] }
let split = { $split: [ "$telephone", "-" ] }

use test
db.users.drop();
db.users.insertOne({
    firstname: "Carlos",
    lastname: "Chaves",
    emailaddress: "coaa@gft.com ",
    telephone: "611-111-123"
});

let pipeline = [{ 
    $set: {
        fconcat: concat,
        ftrim: ltrim,
        findex: index,
        fsplit: split,
    }
}]

db.users.aggregate(pipeline).explain().command.pipeline
```

### How to write Aggregations
- Think as a programmer - not as a DB shell
- Variables help to keep track of brackets

```javascript
let query_no_celebs = {$match:{"user.followers_count" :{$lt: 200000}}}
let projection_name_only = {$project:{"user.name":1, " user.followers_count": 1, _id: 0}}
let sort_most_popular = {$sort: {"user.followers_count": -1}} 
let limit_first_in_list = {$limit: 1}

let pipeline = [query_no_celebs, projection_name_only, sort_most_popular,limit_first_in_list]

db.twitter.aggregate(pipeline)
```

### Visual Aggregation Builder
- Included in Data Explorer
- Provides template code for stages
- Shows live preview of results
- Useful for learning
- Can export pipeline to code

### Exercise - Max property price

Use the **Compass** aggregation builder to work with the **sample_airbnb** database and the **listingsAndReviews** collection and answer for these questions:

Scenario: The base price for the basic rental is **\$price**; that price includes the number of guests provided in **\$guests_included** field. But a property may take more guests in total (**\$accommodates**). Those extra guests pay an **\$extra_people** cost per person for every person more than the number of guests included.

1. How many extra guests can each property have? Add that as a new field with **\$set**
2. How much it would cost with these extra guests? Use **\$project** to show the basic price and the maximum price if fully occupied with **\$accommodates** people

### The $group stage
- Groups documents by a **group key**
- Each unique **group key** value represents one **group** 
- Output is **one document per group** 
- Additional fields can contain results of **accumulator expressions**


```javascript
//Syntax: 
{
    $group: {
        _id: <expression>, //group key
        field1: {<accumulator>: <expression>}
    }
}

{
    $group: {
        _id: "$country", //group key
        urban_population:{$sum: "$city_population" }
    }
}

```

### Common $group accumulators


| **Name** 	| **Description** 	|
|---	|---	|
| \$addToSet 	| array of unique expression values|
| \$avg 	| average of numerical values|
| \$first/$last 	| value from the first or last document for each group|
| \$max/$min 	| highest or lowest expression value for each group|
| \$mergeObjects 	| document combined by input documents for each group|
| \$push 	| array of expression values for each group|
| \$sum 	| sum of numerical values|


### Grouping: $sortByCount
- Shortcut for one of the most popular groupings to do
- See what the most common values are of a field
```javascript
[
{ $group: {
    id: "$city" ,
    count: {$sum: 1 },
    $sort: {count: -1} }
}
]

[ { $sortByCount: "$city" } ]

```

### Exercise - Properties by country

Use **Compass** aggregation builder to work with the **sample_airbnb** database and the **listingsAndReviews** collection and answer for this question:

- How many properties are there in each country (**\$address.country**)? 
- Order countries by number of properties descending, listing the country with the largest number first

Hint: Count things by adding an explicit value 1 to an accumulator using $sum
